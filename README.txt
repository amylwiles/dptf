Just a test
Intel (R) Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework (Intel (R) DPTF) 
for Chromium OS - 8.1.x Release 

README

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document describes how to build and integrate DPTF to Chromimum OS. Please
note that DPTF is already fully integrated to "rambi" and "strago" derived 
overlays by default if you build from the upstream code from chromium.org.
On overlays where DPTF is not enabled by default, you can use this guide and
follow the necessary steps to build and enable it.

This document assumes that the user has already set up the Chromium OS SDK on
their development machine. Otherwise, please refer to Google's "Chromium OS 
Developer Guide" available at:

	http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-guide

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MANUALLY INSTALL DPTF TO OVERLAYS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1 - Enter the Chromium OS SDK chroot environment by running the command:

	sudo <chromimumos root>/chromite/bin/cros_sdk

Step 2 - Check the kernel version of the overlay of interest. Currently DPTF
only supports 3.10 and 3.18 kernel on chromium.org. You must use either one 
in order to proceed further.

Step 3 - The following kernel config flags must be enabled/disabled in order
for DPTF to be functional.

For 3.18 kernel based overlays:
CONFIG_ACPI_THERMAL_REL=y
CONFIG_INT340X_THERMAL=y
CONFIG_INTEL_RAPL=y
CONFIG_INTEL_SOC_DTS_THERMAL=y
CONFIG_IOSF_MBI=y
CONFIG_POWERCAP=y

For 3.10 kernel based overlays:

# CONFIG_CPU_THERMAL is not set
CONFIG_INTEL_DPTF=m
CONFIG_INTEL_DPTF_ACPI=m
CONFIG_INTEL_DPTF_CPU=m	# Set only if overlay has a PCI CPU Reporting device
CONFIG_INTEL_DPTF_PCH=m	# Set only if overlay has a PCI PCH Reporting device
CONFIG_IOSF_MBI=y

Step 4 - Check if the overlay of interest has DPTF enabled or not. Edit the 
src/overlays/overlay-${BOARD}/make.conf and add this line if DPTF is not enabled
yet on this overlay:

USE="${USE} dptf"

Step 5 - Check if CMake has been installed on host Portage, and if not, run 
this command to install:

	sudo emerge cmake

Step 6 - Manually run emerge-${BOARD} to build and merge DPTF to target. Please
note that by default, the cross compiler disables C++ exception handling. You 
will have to pass the CXXFLAGS that enables C++ exception handling to ebuild:

	CXXFLAGS='-fexceptions' emerge-${BOARD} virtual/dptf

Step 7 - Build the target image and you should see DPTF integrated to the 
target image after the build is done. To build the target image, under the
src/scripts directory, run:

	./build_image --board=${BOARD} --noenable_rootfs_verification dev

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD ARTIFACTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emerge of DPTF will install the following components to the target file system:

/etc/init/dptf.conf	# This is the upstart DPTF service configuration file
/etc/dptf/dsp.dv	# This is the DPTF data vault file
/usr/bin/esif_ufd	# This is the main DPTF service executable
/usr/lib64/Dptf.so	# DPTF manager shared object
/usr/lib64/DptfPolicyCritical.so	# DPTF Critical Policy shared object
/usr/lib64/DptfPolicyPassive.so		# DPTF Passive Policy shared object
/usr/lib64/DptfPolicyActive.so	# (optional), DPTF Active Policy shared object
/usr/share/dptf/combined.xsl	# Various DPTF tables in XML format

Please note that if your overlay runs 3.10 kernel, you will also see the
following additional kernel modules installed under 
/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/platform/x66/intel_dptf/

esif_lf_driver.ko	# ESIF (Eco-System Independent Framework) driver
dptf_acpi.ko		# DPTF driver for ACPI participants
dptf_cpu.ko		# (optional depending on overlays) - DPTF CPU driver
dptf_pch.ko		# (optional depending on overlays) - DPTF PCH driver

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNINSTALL DPTF
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uninstalling DPTF is fairly straightforward, you just need to know the kernel
version of the overlay, and if it is 3.10, then type:

emerge-${BOARD} dptf-3_10 --unmerge

Otherwise, type:

emerge-${BOARD} dptf --unmerge

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERIFY INSTALL/CONFIGURATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upon system boot, you should be able to observe the esif_ufd process that has
been launched by upstart.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MANUALLY INSTALL DPTF ON UBUNTU LINUX
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even though DPTF is not yet officially supported on Linux, users who wish to
try it on Linux can follow steps below. Please note that these steps apply to
Ubuntu Linux only, and may vary if your Linux distro is different.

Requirement: DPTF requires corresponding ACPI support in BIOS. Not all
Intel based platforms support DPTF in BIOS. Please contact your BIOS vendor
to see if DPTF is enabled in your system.

The 8.1.x version of DPTF also requires 4.0-rc7 kernel or later in order to 
run properly. To compile the DPTF source code, you need GCC version 4.8 or
later.

Step 1 - Install CMake tool if you have not installed it on your Linux system:

	sudo apt-get install cmake

Step 2 - Install libreadline if you have not done so already on your Linux
system:

	sudo apt-get install libreadline6 libreadline6-dev

Step 3 - Go to the Linux subdirectory of DPTF (<DPTF root>/DPTF/Linux/build)
and run the command:

	cmake ..

This command will invoke cmake and generate all the GNU make files for each 
sub-modules of DPTF user space libraries. By default this command will 
generate the make files for 64-bit release version. If you want to build a 
different flavor, please examine the <DPTF root>/DPTF/Linux/CMakeLists.txt
to find out what environment variables that you may need to pass to cmake.

Step 4 - Run make to build all DPTF shared libraries.

	make -j`nproc`

The generated shared libraries will be located under 
<DPTF root>/Products/DPTF/Linux/build/x64 directory. Users can disregard
the static .a libraries as these static libraries are only used to build the
shared library. Here is the break down of the generated shared libraries that
are needed to run DPTF on Linux:

	* Dptf.so
	* DptfPolicyActive.so
	* DptfPolicyCritical.so
	* DptfPolicyPassive.so

Step 5 - Copy the above shared libraries and other DPTF configuration files
to proper locations on your system:

	sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/dptf/bin
	sudo cp Dptf*.so /usr/share/dptf/bin
	sudo cp <DPTF root>/DPTF/Sources/combined.xsl /usr/share/dptf/bin
	sudo mkdir -p /etc/dptf
	sudo cp <DPTF root>/ESIF/Packages/DSP/dsp.dv /etc/dptf

Step 6 - Run make under <DPTF root>/ESIF/Products/ESIF_UF/Linux to build
the esif_ufd executable. This is the main DPTF service executable that loads
the DPTF policies that you have built in Step 3. After the build is complete,
you will find the esif_ufd executable generated under the same directory.

Please note that the default make target is a 64-bit release version. If you
want to build a different flavor, please examine the Makefile under this 
directory to find out what environment variable you want to pass to Gnu make.
Please do not alter the default settings for OS, OPT_GMIN and OPT_DBUS 
environment variables - they are for Chromium OS builds only, and for Linux
builds, please use the default values.

Step 7 - Copy the DPTF executable to the proper location on your system:
	sudo cp esif_ufd /usr/bin

Step 8 - Start DPTF. Simply run:
	sudo /usr/bin/esif_ufd

This executable will run in daemon mode, and DPTF policies will automatically
be loaded by this executable. You can check the status of the DPTF service
by running this command:

	pgrep -l esif_ufd

This command will show the active DPTF process ID.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL DPTF SERVICE INIT SCRIPT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want the DPTF service to start automatically upon system boot, assuming
that you are using upstart init system (which is the case for both Chromium OS
and Ubuntu), you can simply copy the dptf.conf script to /etc/init:

	sudo cp <DPTF root>/Packages/Installers/chrome/dptf.conf /etc/init/

On next system reboot, DPTF service (esif_ufd) will execute automatically. To
manually stop the running DPTF service, type:

	sudo initctl stop dptf

To start a stopped service, type:

	sudo initctl start dptf

To restart the DPTF service, type:

	sudo initctl restart dptf

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Testing has only been performed on Intel BayTrail-M and Braswell based
Chromebook platforms and the 4th generation Intel® Core ™ processor based
development platforms using the UEFI BIOS.

* Compilation warnings will be noticed during the build for overlays that run
3.10 kernel. No warnings should be observed though for overlays that are based
on 3.18 kernel.
